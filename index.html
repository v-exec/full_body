			<p id="infoText">Full_Body is a web application made to help organize and sequence fitness exercises in the effort of ultimately making my time exercising more engaging. It supports a large number of exercises that require little to no equipment since I quite enjoy calisthenics-oriented workouts. It also has a variety of features for how it should sequence your workouts which should hopefully make this useful for my future use and that of anyone else who would like to use this app.

			This application uses cookies to save your workout plan, meaning that in the event that your browser or computer changes, or deletes these cookies, your workout will unfortunately be erased. This is my way of avoiding using a database while still giving different users the ability to have a unique experience.
			<br>
			<br>
			I hope you enjoy using this as much as I do! If you'd like to know more about this app, please check out the <a class="infoLink" href="https://github.com/v-exec/full_body">github page</a>.

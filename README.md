# full_body

_full\_body_ is an exercise sequencer. This simple web application is meant to provide a more varied way of performing a workout. By providing it with a list of exercises, it will generate a unique sequence of exercises each time, making each workout less monotonous!

Not only that, but _full\_body_ helps you stay motivated with a progress tracker, and lots of flavor text to keep you engaged. Each exercise also has text associated with it that describes the exercise and keeps you focused and mindful of your form.

In addition, _full\_body_ includes various clocks for timing the total session time, amount of time taking breaks, and a countdown timer with audio feedback for timed exercises like planks.

And of course, it works on mobile.

Additional documentation can be found on [my site](https://v-os.ca/full_body).

## How To Use

_full\_body_ is run entirely on the web, on [v-os](https://exp.v-os.ca/full_body).
In its current iteration, everything you need is available at the site above!

## Supported Movements

_full\_body_ includes a list of exercises that each contain the following information: `exercise name`, `movement type`, `primary muscle group`, `secondary muscle group`, `targeted body area`. These are used to generate the text that appears under each one when it comes up in your sequence, and to sequence the exercises randomly. These are primarily calisthenic exercises, and therefore _full\_body_ does not include information like weights.

If you feel like you want more movements added to the existing list, please let me know, and I'll be happy to add them! Just email me [here](mailto:victor.ivanov.design@gmail.com).

## Disclaimers

- This application **uses cookies to save your workout plan**, and therefore may lose your data in the event you clear your cookies.

- This application is a fun way to add some variety to one's workout, but it is **not a substitue for professionally offered advice**, and does not claim to be more efficient or performative than any other workout approach.

- The small database of exercises is a result of my amateur online research. I am in no ways an expert, and am fairly certain that some of my generated flavor text for each exercise is to some degree inaccurate. So if you know about fitness and want to make corrections to exercise names, targeted muscle groups, or the generated text descriptions please [email me](mailto:victor.ivanov.design@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to incorporate your feedback!

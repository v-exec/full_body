# full_body

_full\_body_ is an exercise sequencer. This simple web application is meant to provide a more varied way of performing a workout. By providing it with a list of exercises, it will generate a unique sequence of exercises each time, making each workout less monotonous!

Not only that, but _full\_body_ helps you stay motivated with a progress tracker and pretty interface.

In addition, _full\_body_ includes various clocks for timing the total session time, amount of time taking breaks, and a countdown timer with audio feedback for timed exercises like planks.

And of course, it works on mobile.
